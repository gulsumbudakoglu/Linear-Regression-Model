# Linear-Regression-Model
Linear RegressiÄ±n Model with Python

With dataset1, I evaluate the issue below:

part (a): To see how the populatiton size affect the model's performance, randomly take samples of size 100, 150, 200, ...., 950, 1000 (i.e., incrementing sample sizes by 50) from the given dataset, apply train-test split (%70 train-%30 test), fit a multiple linear regression model, evaluate the mean square performance of the model on the train and test sets and plot results.

part(b): Repeat part (a) after applying polynomial expansion with degree=2 and set to the given dataset.

part(c): Use Lasso regularization and try to fit the best possible model to the given dataset. Use (%70 train - %30 test) splits.
